This program computes and visualizes the disparity map and 3D reconstruction from a pair of rectified stereo images.

Instructions:
- Load two rectified stereo images (left and right views).
- The disparity map will be computed using seed expansion and normalized cross-correlation (NCC).
- View the computed disparity map and the 3D reconstruction of the scene.
- Click to close the program.
